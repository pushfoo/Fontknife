# Disabled until emoji safety for each formant is better understood.
# PDF's LaTeX-based pipeline fails when encountering any, and epub's
# build was cancelled because of it.
# formats:
#   - pdf
#   - epub

# TL;DR for contributors:
# 1. Install using pip install -e .[dev,docs]
# 2. Whenever you update deps, pip-compile --extras docs -o docs/requirements.txt pyproject.toml to freeze all deps

# Based on recommendations from readthedocs at:
