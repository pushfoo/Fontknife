**Q**: How do I convert a font into a sprite sheet?<br/>
**A**: `fontknife convert`

## Install Instructions

### Users

If you only want to convert fonts, follow these steps:

1. Have [Python](https://python.org) 3.9+ installed
2. Make sure you've [created](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-enviroments)
   and [activated](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work)
   a virtual environemnt (or use [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/))
3. `pip install
4. Run `fontknife convert --help`

If the last command print help text, you're ready to go! Read it for a descirption of supported arguments.

### Developers / Contributors

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/pushfoo/fontknife/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Current Features

* Read multiple font formats (TTF, BDF, PCF, 1-bit sprite sheets)
* Read arbitrary unicode glyphs from supported fonts, including
  [multi-character emoji](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-zwj-sequences.html)
* Export 1-bit sprite sheets to multiple image formats (PNG, BMP, JPG)
* Guess common formats from file extensions
* Simpler than GUI font editors
* Can be used as a library in custom Python scripts
* Assembly code generation (Partial support for [Octo](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo))

Please remember:

1. This is alpha quality software, so there will be bugs and breaking changes
2. The [Future Features](#future-features) section lists known areas for improvements
3. The project accepts [pull requests](https://github.com/pushfoo/fontknife/pulls)


## Why did you make this?

1. It helps developers [iterate faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDjrOaoHz9s).
2. A refactor of an abandoned projected turned into something else.

## Practical Examples

### 1. Export Specific Glyphs / Make Game Assets

**Scenario**: You need filler assets for a farming game, ASAP.<br/>
**Solution**:

1. Download an appropriately licensed emoji font, such as
[Noto Emoji](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Emoji),
2. Run the following command
    ```commandline
    fontknife convert -P 48 -G "üåΩüçáüçéüçèü´êüçìüçíüçêüçÖü•ïü•îü•íüçëü•ëüßÖüçà" NotoEmoji-Regular.ttf fruits_and_veggies.png
    ```
3. Double check & color the results with your preferred image editor

### 3. Generate Octo Assembly

_Note: This feature is mostly broken legacy code inherited from
an earlier project._

You can generate a width table and sprite data table as valid
[Octo](https://github.com/JohnEarnest/Octo) source if your font meets
the following requirements:

1. All glyphs can render as 8px x 8px or smaller
2. There are 256 or fewer glyphs in the font

For example, run the following to generate tables of widths and sprite data
for [Tom Thumb](https://robey.lag.net/2010/01/23/tiny-monospace-font.html)
as Octo source:

```commandline
fontknife emit-code tom-thumb.bdf tom-thumb.8o
```

The data tables should be usable, but the attached drawing routines are not:

1. Their underlying logic is broken
2. They predate Octo's idiomatic [`:stringmode` macro](http://johnearnest.github.io/Octo/docs/Manual.html#strings)


## Future features
